## Ruth2 v4 Mesh

* **Ruth2v4Dev.blend**: This blender file is a compilation of all the parts
  used for Ruth2 v4. All collaborators should use this file as a basis for
  future improvements, which under the AGPL license should be made freely
  and publicly available.

* The .blend file, Collada (DAE) exports of parts and the UV maps
  are copied from Ruth2/Contrib/Ada Radius as at 2-Sep-2020.

* The .blend file is equivalent to Ada Radius Draft 11.

* Most parts are unchanged since Draft 9. Elements with head part changed at Draft 10. Eyelashes changed at Draft 10. All nails changed at Draft 11.

* Ruth2v4Dev.blend objects were built in Blender 2.83. Armatures and custom properties have been removed. The objects in the file are UV mapped to the legacy 2005 Second Life UV map island edges and vertex weighted to be compatible with the Second Life/OpenSim 2016 "Bento" armature, using Avastar tools from its beta 2.81.35. 

* More information on use of the model in Blender, rigging and weighting and use with the Avastar plugin are in this Wiki page... https://github.com/RuthAndRoth/Ruth2/wiki/Blender-and-Rigging
